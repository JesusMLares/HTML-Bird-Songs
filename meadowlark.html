        <!-- Description of bird -->
        <p>
            The Meadowlark is a songbird belonging to the genus Sturnella, which is native to North and Central America. There are several species of Meadowlarks, with the Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) being the most well-known.
        </p>

            Meadowlarks are known for their striking appearance and beautiful songs. They have brownish or streaked plumage on their upperparts and bright yellow underparts, with a distinctive black V-shaped bib on their chest. Their long, pointed bills are adapted for foraging on the ground for insects, seeds, and grains.
        </p>

            These birds are commonly found in open grasslands, meadows, prairies, and agricultural fields, where they perch on fence posts or low shrubs to sing their melodious songs. Meadowlarks are highly territorial during the breeding season and use their songs to establish and defend their territories, as well as to attract mates.

            The Meadowlark's song is a sweet, flute-like whistle that carries across the open landscape, making it a symbol of the North American countryside. While their numbers have declined in some areas due to habitat loss and changes in agricultural practices, efforts to conserve their grassland habitats are underway to ensure the continued presence of these iconic birds in the wild.
