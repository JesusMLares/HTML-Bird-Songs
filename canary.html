        <!-- Description of bird -->
        <p>
            A canary bird, scientifically known as Serinus canaria domestica, is a small, brightly colored bird that
            belongs to the finch family. Originally native to the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores, canaries are
            now bred and kept as pets worldwide. They are known for their melodious songs, vibrant plumage, and gentle
            temperament.
        </p>
        <p>

            Canaries typically have a compact, rounded body with a conical beak adapted for seed-eating. Their plumage
            comes in a variety of colors including yellow, orange, white, and combinations thereof, with males often
            exhibiting brighter hues to attract mates.
        <p>
            Historically, canaries were used in coal mines as early warning systems for toxic gases, due to their
            sensitivity to airborne pollutants. If the birds showed signs of distress or died, it signaled the presence
            of dangerous gases, alerting miners to evacuate.

            In modern times, canaries are popular as companion pets, valued for their beautiful songs and relatively low
            maintenance. They require a proper diet of seeds, fresh water, and occasional fruits or vegetables, as well
            as adequate space to fly and exercise within a cage. With proper care, canaries can live for several years
            and bring joy to their owners with their cheerful songs and charming personalities.
